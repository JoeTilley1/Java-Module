# Java-Module
During my own time, I complete half of the Java course for the University of Warwick. A lot of the code was already provided and it was a case of filling in the gaps (this can be seen in the codes, comments of where code needs to be filled in is written). Involves analysing a large set of data about overlapping circles and generating images of Newton Fractals.
